# DataStructures Library

Simple implementations of common data structures used for learning and examples.

Included:
- `Stack<T>` - LIFO stack
- `Queue<T>` - FIFO queue
- `LinkedList<T>` - singly-linked list with head/tail
- `HashMap<TKey,TValue>` - thin wrapper around `Dictionary`
- `BinarySearchTree<T>` - BST with insert, contains, and in-order traversal

Examples and unit tests are in the `Tests` project.
